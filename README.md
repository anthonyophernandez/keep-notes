# keep-notes

## Description

A clone of Google Keep.

It does have:
* Create / Copy / Delete (Move to Trash)
* Delete forever / Restore
* Archive / Unarchive
* Pinned / Unpinned
* Change color
* Label system
* Grid 

However, it doesn't have all the functions of Google Keep like search, reminders, snackbar system, etc.

And it uses an API mocking library - Mirage JS.

```
npm install
npm run serve
